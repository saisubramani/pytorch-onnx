This Reprository is mainly for converting the pytorch model to onnx model.

** Note : **

1. Note that ONNX Runtime is compatible with Python versions 3.5 to 3.7
2. Install the Python 3.5 >= 3.7
3. Install pip using this command ** sudo apt install python3-pip **
2. Install torch and torchvision using requirement.txt file 
3. Install ONNX, It will be installed while runing the requirement.txt
4. If you want to compile with CUDA support, install Nvidia CUDA 9 or above and Nvidia cuDNN v7 or above
